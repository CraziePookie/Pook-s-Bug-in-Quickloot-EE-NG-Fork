Not sure how to easily compile a list of mods I am using but to include some which seem relevant...

skypatcher, skyui, mcm helper, skse, bees, jcontainers, papyrus util, all in one address library, inventory interface information injector, true hud

and of course QuicklootEE-NG 1.1.0

All downloaded today as the most recent versions
